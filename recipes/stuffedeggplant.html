    <h1>Stuffed Eggplant Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Eggplant:</b> Youâ€™ll need one eggplant (halved lengthwise) to make two servings.</li>
        <li><b>Olive oil:</b> Brush the shells with olive oil before seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Seasonings:</b> This stuffed eggplant is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and fresh basil. </li>
        <li><b>Sausage:</b> Sweet Italian sausage makes this stuffed eggplant a hearty, crowd-pleasing meal. </li>
        <li><b>Vegetables:</b> An onion and fresh mushrooms lend texture and flavor. </li>
        <li><b>Pasta sauce:</b> Use store-bought or homemade tomato-basil pasta sauce. </li>
        <li><b>Bread crumbs:</b> Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs give the stuffed eggplant a welcome crunch. </li>
        <li><b>Cheese:</b> For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese instead of using the
            pre-shredded
            stuff. </li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.
        </li>
        <li>Cut around the edge of the flesh in each eggplant half using a sharp paring knife, leaving a 1/2-inch
            border. Scoop out flesh using a spoon, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; reserve flesh and chop into bite-size
            pieces.</li>
        <li>Brush shells with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Add sausage, onion,
            mushrooms, and garlic; cook and stir until sausage is evenly brown. Stir in reserved chopped eggplant and
            basil. Add pasta sauce; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup of panko and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Stuff mixture into eggplant shells. Combine remaining panko and cheese in a small bowl; sprinkle over
            stuffing.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is tender, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
